      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">Thank you for considering me as a tutor!</span> I
        am truly grateful for being given the opportunity to be a tutor, and as
        such, I aim to provide the best experience possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If this is your first time receiving tutoring from me, I normally have a
        short introduction meeting with parents in order to ensure that I am
        able to <span class="emphasis">deliver the best support possible</span>.
        Please use the form below to schedule a meeting with me for
        about 15 minutes so that we can get to know each other a little bit
        better! If you prefer, you can also contact me by shooting an email to <a href="mailto:tutoring@saharsh.tech">tutoring@saharsh.tech</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have already received tutoring from me before and would just like
        to schedule another tutoring session, feel free to
        <span class="emphasis">request for as much time as you would like</span>
        and you can pay me based on the rate that we have previously agreed on.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">My hourly prices are negotiable</span>, so feel
        free to bring up a price that you are comfortable with during our
        preliminary meeting. You can choose to pay in cash when we meet in
        person, or through
        <a href="https://paypal.me/saharshy">PayPal</a>.
      </p>

      <p>In the subject field, please put "Tutoring with {{student name}}".</p>
